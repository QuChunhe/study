Borel Subsets in X are measurable

B = Borel sets = sigma algebra generated by all  open  subsets

a = sigma algebra induced by  outer measure

B belongs  to a

metric outer measure => Borel  subset  of R^n are Lebesgue measurable

[CHAPTER 3 Measurable functions](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/measure_theory/measure_notes_ch3.pdf)

Measurable functions in measure theory are analogous to continuous functions in  topology.   A  continuous  function  pulls  back  open  sets  to  open  sets,  while  a measurable function pulls back measurable sets to measurable sets

[An Exploration of the Cantor Set](https://missouriwestern.edu/orgs/momaa/ChrisShaver-CantorSetPaper4.pdf)

A set S is said to be perfect if S = S', where S' is the set of all the limit points of S. Inother words, S is perfect if S is a closed set in which every point is a limit point of S.

A set S is said to be nowhere dense if the interior of the closure of S is empty.

a set is perfect if the set is closed and all the points of the set are limit points of the set.

Properties of the Cantor ternary set C3
* C3 has uncountably many elements.
* C3 contains no intervals.
* C3 is compact.
* C3 is perfect.
* C3 is nowhere dense.

So far we have that the Cantor set is a subset of the interval [0, 1] that has uncountably many elementsyet contains no intervals.  It has the cardinality of the real numbers, yet it has zero length.
