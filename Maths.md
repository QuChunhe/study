Borel Subsets in X are measurable

B = Borel sets = sigma algebra generated by all  open  subsets

a = sigma algebra induced by  outer measure

B belongs  to a

metric outer measure => Borel  subset  of R^n are Lebesgue measurable


# Bayesian Statistics

Bradley P. Carlin and Thomas A. Louis,  Bayesian Methods for Data Analysis third edition, Taylor & Francis Group 2009  

Three principal approaches to inference guide modern data analysis: frequentist, Bayesian, and likelihood.  


empirical Bayes (EB)  

In a nutshell, the Likelihood Principle states that once the data value x has been observed, the likelihood function L(θ|x) contains all relevant experimental information delivered by x about the unknown parameter θ.  

Many of these advantages are presented in detail in the popular textbook by Berger
* Bayesian methods provide the user with the ability to formally incorporate prior information.
* Inferences are conditional on the actual data.
* The reason for stopping the experimentation does not affect Bayesian inference.
* Bayesian answers are more easily interpretable by nonspecialists.
* All Bayesian analyses follow directly from the posterior; no separate theories of estimation, testing, multiple comparisons, etc. are needed.
* Any question can be directly answered through Bayesian analysis.
* Bayes and EB procedures possess numerous optimality properties.


The most basic Bayesian model has two stages, with a likelihood specification Y |θ ∼ f(y|θ) and a prior specification θ ∼ π(θ), where either Y or θ can be vectors.
