> 紧是这样一种性质: 若一个集合的任意开覆盖都存在有限子覆盖, 则称这个集合为紧集.  
可以仅凭有界闭集的这条性质证明以下在数学分析中非常重要的定理:
* 极大值定理
* 一致连续定理

在实数空间，紧集=闭集且有界.有限覆盖是个好东西，可以把无限转换到有限，减小讨论的难度。

> 如果一个拓扑空间每一个序列都有收敛的子序列，则称它是列紧的。
> 如果每一个拓扑空间的开覆盖都有有限的子覆盖，则称它是紧致的。

紧致C1空间列紧。

[Improper Integrals](https://www2.math.uconn.edu/~stein/virtual/Notes/Calculus/improperintegrals.pdf)

There are basically two types of problems that lead us to define improper integrals.
* We may, for some reason, want to define an integral on an interval extending to ±∞.This leads to what is sometimes called anImproper Integral of Type 1.
* The  integrand  may  fail  to  be  defined,  or  fail  to  be  continuous,  at  a  point  in  theinterval of integration, typically an endpoint.  This leads to what is sometimes calledan em Improper Integral of Type 2.

For unbounded functions or for unbounded intervals of integration, one defines the Riemann integral as an improper integral.

In elementary calculus, various “improper” Riemann integrals are introduced in order to relax the two requirements (compact domain, boundedness).

B = Borel sets = sigma algebra generated by all  open  subsets

a = sigma algebra induced by  outer measure

B belongs  to a

metric outer measure => Borel  subset  of R^n are Lebesgue measurable

[CHAPTER 3 Measurable functions](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/measure_theory/measure_notes_ch3.pdf)

Measurable functions in measure theory are analogous to continuous functions in  topology. A continuous function pulls back open  sets  to  open sets,  while  a measurable function pulls back measurable sets to measurable sets

[An Exploration of the Cantor Set](https://missouriwestern.edu/orgs/momaa/ChrisShaver-CantorSetPaper4.pdf)

A set S is said to be perfect if S = S', where S' is the set of all the limit points of S. Inother words, 
S is perfect if S is a closed set in which every point is a limit point of S.

A set S is said to be nowhere dense if the interior of the closure of S is empty.

a set is perfect if the set is closed and all the points of the set are limit points of the set.

Properties of the Cantor ternary set C3
* C3 has uncountably many elements.
* C3 contains no intervals.
* C3 is compact.
* C3 is perfect.
* C3 is nowhere dense.

So far we have that the Cantor set is a subset of the interval [0, 1] that has uncountably many elements yet contains no 
intervals.  It has the cardinality of the real numbers, yet it has zero length.

若尔当容度(Jordan content)是长度(或面积、体积)概念的一种推广。若尔当容度具有非负、单调、有限可加及在正交变换下(可测性及容度)不变等性质。它是由佩亚诺(Peano，G.)于1887年、若尔当(Jordan，M.E.C.)于1892年提出的。若尔当在其1893年出版的《分析教程》中对它作了详细阐述，提出的目的主要是为了完善黎曼意义下的二重积分理论
