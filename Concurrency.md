“synchronization” refers to relationships among events—any number of events, and any kind of relationship (before, during,
after). Computer programmers are often concerned with synchronization constraints, which are requirements pertaining to 
the order of events
* Serialization: Event A must happen before Event B.
* Mutual exclusion: Events A and B must not happen at the same time.

需要同步的原因
* 并发执行：多处理器，即使单处理器也会多线程，从而需要控制线程的同步 
* 资源共享
* 乱序执行：
* cache，数据不一致

* Pillar 1: Responsiveness and Isolation Via Asynchronous Agents
* Pillar 2: Throughput and Scalability Via Concurrent Collections
* Pillar 3: Consistency Via Safely Shared Resources

|Order  |O(1): Single-Core|O(K): Fixed|O(N): Scalable
| :------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------| 
|Tagline |	One thing at a time |	Explicit threading |	Re-enable the free lunch|
|Summary |	Sequential applications, and bottlenecked parallel applications |	Explicitly express how much work can be done in parallel|Express lots of latent concurrency in a way that can be efficiently mapped to N cores|  
|Examples |Multithreaded code convoyed on a global lock or message queue, occasional or intermittent background work|Pipelining, hardwired division of tasks, regular or continuous background computation |Tree traversal, quicksort, compilation|  
|Applicability |	Single-core hardware, single-threaded OS, or nonCPU-bound app |	Hardware with fixed concurrency, or app whose CPU-bound parts have limited scalability |	Hardware with variable (esp. growing) concurrency, and app with CPU-bound parts that are scalably parallelizable|
|Examples |	Code targeting legacy hardware, small embedded systems, single-core game consoles; simple text processor |	Game targeting one multicore game console generation; code whose key operations are order-sensitive (e.g., can be pipelined but not fully parallelized) |	Mainstream desktop or server software with CPU-bound features and targeting commodity hardware or future upgradeable game consoles|

 exploiting natural parallelism
 * Exploit parallelism in algorithm structures: For example, recursive sorting can exploit the natural parallelism in its divide-and-conquer structure. 
 * Exploit parallelism in data structures: For example, tree traversal can often exploit the independence in each node's subtrees. Compilation can exploit independence at several levels in the structure of source code, from coarse-grained independence among source files to finer-grained independence among classes or methods within a file.
