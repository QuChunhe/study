  Data modeling in a relational database is driven entirely by data. You can also say that
relational data modeling is table-driven. Normalization theory rules the roost, and this
theory requires that you not duplicate data.  
  Queries and not data drive Cassandra’s data modeling methodology. This means that
you organize your data based on the queries you expect that data to serve. You design
your queries first and create your tables to satisfy those queries. You consider data
duplication as quite normal, as a side effect of nesting data.  

[p105]  
Cassandra Data Modeling Rules
* Spreading Data Evenly Across the Cluster
* Minimizing the Number of Partitions to Be Read
   
[p107]  
Modeling Around Queries and Not Around Relations
* Find out the queries the database must support
* Create appropriate tables.
   
[p114]  
  In a multiple partition batch operation, the coordinator node can turn out to be a bottleneck during a batch operation. The higher the number of partitions in a batch operation, the higher the latency due to batching.
   
[p145]   
  Write operations that use only a single partition are fine performance-wise.
   
[p146]   

  Even in cases with multiple partitions, if the operations involve only small inserts or updates, you’ll be fine with batching those operations to ensure consistency.

[p151]  
  It’s a good idea to have a separate keyspace per application.


[p156]  
  DataStax recommends that you use a small number of seeds, such as three nodes per datacenter. You should specify the same list of nodes
  for all nodes in a cluster. If your cluster has multiple datacenters, include at least one node from each datacenter as seed providers.

[p169]  
  DataStax recommends that you use the parallel and partitioner range options during a repair wherever it’s possible to do so.
```
$nodetool repair -pr hosts 10.2.2.30 10.2.2.31
```

[170] 
  Ideally, you should run incremental repairs every day and a full repair less frequently, like every month, unless you believe you need to do it more often.

[p183]  
  Tip The Murmur3Partitioner is 3-5 times faster in performance than the RandomPartitioner.

[185]  
  The choice of a snitch affects where Cassandra places replicas. Thepurpose of a snitch is to route requests efficiently and to distribute replicas evenly.  
DataStax recommends GossipingPropertyFileSnitch for production usage.


[190]  
  A keyspace is a logical structure where Cassandra stores not only table data, but also all other entities that you create for an application, such as materialized views, functions, aggregates, and UDTs.

[199]
  By default, the replication factor for the system-auth keyspace is set to 1. DataStax recommends that you set the replication factor for the system-auth tablespace to the number of nodes in each of the datacenters. However, you can set the replication factor for this keyspace to 5 or 7, which offers plenty of redundancy.

[201]  
  Note A primary key consists of two things: the first column or columns is the mandatory partition key, followed by one or more clustering columns.

[202]  
  Here’s what the two parts mean:
* Cassandra uses the first part of the definition of a primary key, the partition key, to distribute the data in the table across the cluster’s nodes. The partition key determines which node will store a specific row of the table. A compound partition key can split the data to store related data on separate partitions.
* The database uses the second part of the key definition, called the clustering key or clustering column (or columns), to order or sort the data within the partition.

[203]  
  Note A partition key groups rows in the same replica set. The clustering columns dictate how rows are stored in the replica.

[209]   
  You set the gc_grace_seconds property when creating a table. This property specifies the number of seconds after Cassandra marks data with a tombstone before the data becomes eligible for garbage collection.   

  a table for which you’ve configured the default_time_to_live property.


[305]  
  The nodetool rebuild command is useful when you’re adding a datacenter to your cluster. You can rebuild a single keyspace at a time or specify multiple keyspaces, each separated by a comma.

[306]   
  You don’t have to manually clean up after every such change in a cluster. However, if for any reason you wish to reclaim disk space faster, you can run the nodetool cleanup command.

[326]   
  In situations such as when you’re getting ready to upgrade Cassandra, you want to ensure that you flush all memtables to disk, into the SSTables. You run the nodetool drain command to flush memtables to SSTables on disk.

[341]  
  Key nodetool commands that you’ll often use for checking a cluster’s health are the following:
* nodetool status
* nodetool info
*nodetool tpstats

 [337]    
   The nodetool proxyhistograms command shows the network statistics in a cluster.
 
 [338]   
  Run the nodetool tablestats (formerly nodetool cfstats) command to get statistics about one or more tables.  
You run the nodetool decommission command to make a node send all its data to the next node in the ring. Decommissioning a node is the opposite of bootstrapping a node.  


[379]  
  You can set the bloom_filter_fp_chance attribute for a table to a value between 0 and 1. As you go from 0 to 1, you use less memory. A value of 0 means you set the largest value for the Bloom filter and use the highest amount of memory. Setting it to 1 means that you’ve disabled Bloom filters.

[422]  
  There are two good nodetool commands that help you identify performance issues in a cluster: nodetool proxyhistograms and nodetool tablehistograms. Both commands present performance statistics captured by the database in the form of histograms, hence
the command names.
