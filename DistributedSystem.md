causality, physical time, logical time

monotonicity property associated with causality in distributed systems.

Causality (or the causal precedence relation)

[51] Every event is assigned a timestamp and the causality relation between events can be generally inferred from their timestamps. The timestamps assigned to events obey the fundamental monotonicity property; that is, if an event a causally affects an event b, then the timestamp of a is smaller than the timestamp of b.  
[52] A system of logical clocks consists of a time domain T and a logical clock C. Elements of T form a partially ordered set over a relation <. This relation is usually called the happened before or causal precedence. 

This monotonicity property is called the clock consistency condition


clock consistency condition v.t. strongly consistent

[52] Implementation of logical clocks requires addressing two issues [19]: data structures local to every process to represent logical time and a protocol (set of rules) to update the data structures to ensure the consistency condition.


two capabilities:
- A local logical clock, denoted by lci,
- A logical global clock, denoted by gci
A local logical clock v.t. A logical global clock,

two rules:
- R1 This rule governs how the local logical clock is updated by a process when it executes an event (send, receive, or internal).
- R2 This rule governs how a process updates its global logical clock to update its view of the global time and global progress.

scalar time, vector time, and matrix time

Total Ordering

The system of scalar clocks is not strongly consistent;

Isomorphism

keeping things as simple as possible. Our view is that a complex problem is really just a collection of smaller, simpler problems waiting to be solved.

##### Rule 1—Don’t Overengineer the Solution

The first category covers products designed and implemented to exceed their useful
requirements.


The second category of overengineering deals with making something overly complex
and making something in a complex way.

##### Rule 2—Design Scale into the Solution　(D-I-D Process)


AKF Partners’ Design-Implement-Deploy or D-I-D approach to thinking about scalability.

##### Rule 3—Simplify the Solution Three Times Over

Pareto principle 即帕累托法则，又称80/20法则、马特莱法则、二八定律、帕累托定律、最省力法则、不平衡原则、犹太法则。意大利经济学家帕累托提出的。法则认为原因和结果、投入和产出、努力和报酬之间本来存在着无法解释的不平衡

There are three primary methods of sending messages:
- Fire-and-forget
- Synchronous send
- Asynchronous send

[73]
Setting session.timeout.ms lower than the default will allow consumer groups to detect and recover from failure
sooner, but may also cause unwanted rebalances as a result of consumers taking longer to complete the poll loop or garbage collection. Setting session.timeout.ms higher will reduce the chance of accidental rebalance, but also means it will take
longer to detect a real failure.


[75]
receive.buffer.bytes and send.buffer.bytes: It can be a good idea to increase those when producers or consumers communicate with brokers in a different datacenter, because those network links typically have higher latency and lower bandwidth.


[77]
By setting auto.commit.offset=false, offsets will only be committed when the application explicitly chooses to do so. The simplest and most reliable of the commit APIs is commitSync().


[78]~[80]  
Combining Synchronous and Asynchronous Commits
- commitSync() will retry the commit until it either succeeds or encounters a nonretriable failure,
- commitAsync() will not retry

[86]  
Note that consumer.wakeup() is the only consumer method that is safe to call from a different thread.  
Before exiting the thread, you must call consumer.close().

快速恢复有些策略。最简单的比如心跳检测、事件监听等。

安全恢复一般主要是在恢复前对系统或数据先做一些检查、数据还原等。

## Flink
There are two basic kinds of state in Flink: Keyed State and Operator State.

Keyed State is always relative to keys and can only be used in functions and operators on a KeyedStream.

With Operator State (or non-keyed state), each operator state is bound to one parallel operator instance. The Kafka Connector is a good motivating example for the use of Operator State in Flink. 

Keyed State and Operator State exist in two forms: managed and raw.

Managed State is represented in data structures controlled by the Flink runtime, such as internal hash tables, or RocksDB. Examples are “ValueState”, “ListState”, etc. Flink’s runtime encodes the states and writes them into the checkpoints.

Raw State is state that operators keep in their own data structures. When checkpointed, they only write a sequence of bytes into the checkpoint. Flink knows nothing about the state’s data structures and sees only the raw bytes.

A third type of supported operator state is the Broadcast State. Broadcast state was introduced to support use cases where some data coming from one stream is required to be broadcasted to all downstream tasks, where it is stored locally and is used to process all incoming elements on the other stream.
