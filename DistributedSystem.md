[51] The timestamps assigned to events obey the fundamental monotonicity property; that is, if an event a causally affects an event b, then the timestamp of a is smaller than the timestamp of b.  
[52] Elements of T form a partially ordered set over a relation <. This relation is usually called the happened before or causal precedence. 


clock consistency condition v.t. strongly consistent

[52] Implementation of logical clocks requires addressing two issues [19]: data structures local to every process to represent logical time and a protocol (set of rules) to update the data structures to ensure the consistency condition.


A local logical clock v.t. A logical global clock,

There are three primary methods of sending messages:
- Fire-and-forget
- Synchronous send
- Asynchronous send

[73]
Setting session.timeout.ms lower than the default will allow consumer groups to detect and recover from failure
sooner, but may also cause unwanted rebalances as a result of consumers taking longer to complete the poll loop or garbage collection. Setting session.timeout.ms higher will reduce the chance of accidental rebalance, but also means it will take
longer to detect a real failure.


[75]
receive.buffer.bytes and send.buffer.bytes: It can be a good idea to increase those when producers or consumers communicate with brokers in a different datacenter, because those network links typically have higher latency and lower bandwidth.


[77]
By setting auto.commit.offset=false, offsets will only be committed when the application explicitly chooses to do so. The simplest and most reliable of the commit APIs is commitSync().


[78]~[80]  
Combining Synchronous and Asynchronous Commits
- commitSync() will retry the commit until it either succeeds or encounters a nonretriable failure,
- commitAsync() will not retry

[86]  
Note that consumer.wakeup() is the only consumer method that is safe to call from a different thread.  
Before exiting the thread, you must call consumer.close().
