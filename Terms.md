Programming Paradigms: fundamentally different approaches to building solutions to specific types of problems

* Procedural Programming: list of instrunctions to tell the computer what to do step by step.
   * procedures
   * routines
   * sub-routines   
 imperative programming
* Object-oriented programming：approach to problem solving where all computations are carried out using objects.
   * Object： component of a program that knows how to perform certain actions and how to ineract with other elements of the program. property and method
   * Class

   * Abstraction
   * Encapsulation
   * Inheritance
   * Polymorphism
   
   
* Functional Programming


Object-oriented  programming
* Object-oriented programming collects information into single entities called objects.
* Each object is a single instance of a class.
* Abstraction hides the inner workings of an object when it’s not necessary to see them.
* Encapsulation stores related variables and methods within objects and protects them.
* Inheritance allows sub-classes to use attributes from parent classes.
* Polymorphism allows objects and methods to deal with multiple different situations with a single interface


* 命令式编程（Imperative programming）：详细的命令机器怎么（How）去处理一件事情以达到你想要的结果（What）；
* 声明式编程（ Declarative programming）：只告诉你想要的结果（What），机器自己摸索过程（How）
