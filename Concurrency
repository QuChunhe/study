“synchronization” refers to relationships among events—any number of events, and any kind of relationship (before, during, after). 
Computer programmers are often concerned with synchronization constraints, which are requirements pertaining to the order of events
* Serialization: Event A must happen before Event B.
* Mutual exclusion: Events A and B must not happen at the same time.
