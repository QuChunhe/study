“synchronization” refers to relationships among events—any number of events, and any kind of relationship (before, during,
after). Computer programmers are often concerned with synchronization constraints, which are requirements pertaining to 
the order of events
* Serialization: Event A must happen before Event B.
* Mutual exclusion: Events A and B must not happen at the same time.

需要同步的原因
* 并发执行：多处理器，即使单处理器也会多线程，从而需要控制线程的同步 
* 资源共享
* 乱序执行：
* cache，数据不一致
